# ChaiCode Web Dev 2026 – Assignments

This repository contains **only** my assignments for the ChaiCode Web Development Cohort 2026.  
All environment / tooling files are for my local setup and are **not** part of the assignment review.

---

## For Assignment Reviewers

- Please **only open**:
  - The `assignments/` folder
  - Then the specific assignment folder (for example: `assignments/01-html-resume-page-assignment/`)
  - Then the source code files inside that folder (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.)

- Please **do not open**, run, or review these files as part of the assignment:
  - `devbox.json`
  - `devbox.lock`
  - `.envrc`
  - Any other environment / tooling / config files I may add later

These are **only environment settings** for my development workflow (Devbox, direnv, etc.), not part of the assignment solution.

## How to View an Assignment

1. Go to the `assignments/` directory.
2. Choose the assignment folder you want to review.
3. Open the main HTML (or other relevant) file in that folder.
4. The expected output / page will be displayed in the README.md files for specific assignments.

Each assignment is self-contained inside its own folder.

## Notes

- If you see any unfamiliar files at the repo root, you can safely ignore them during review.
- All grading / feedback can be based solely on the code inside the `assignments/` subfolders.
