# ChaiCode Web Dev 2026 – Assignments

This repository contains **only** my assignments for the ChaiCode Web Development Cohort 2026.  
All environment / tooling files are for my local setup and are **not** part of the assignment review.

## For Assignment Reviewers

Please **only open**:
- The `assignments/` folder
- Then the specific assignment folder (for example: `assignments/01-html-resume-page-assignment/`)
- Then the source code files inside that folder (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.)

Please **do not open**, run, or review these files as part of the assignment:
- `devbox.json`
- `devbox.lock`
- `.envrc`
- Any other environment / tooling / config files I may add later

These are **only environment settings** for my development workflow (Devbox, direnv, etc.), not part of the assignment solution.

## Notes

- If you see any unfamiliar files at the repo root, you can safely ignore them during review.
- All grading / feedback can be based solely on the code inside the `assignments/` subfolders.
